## ðŸš€ Instructions

### Download and Install
1. **Download** the provided ZIP file from the releases section.
2. **Unzip** the downloaded folder.
3. **Choose your installation method:**
   - **Option 1:** Place the unzipped files directly into your main Garry's Mod game directory.
   - **Option 2 (Optional for separation):**
     1. Make a copy of your Garry's Mod folder (e.g., `garrysmod`) and rename it to `GarrysmodRTX`.
     2. Place the unzipped files into the new `GarrysmodRTX` folder.

4. **Run the GmodInstaller:**
   - The installer will guide you to locate your `gmod.exe` and `hl2.exe` files based on the directory you selected above.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to configure the paths correctly.

5. **Subscribe to Required Mods:**
   - Visit your [Steam Workshop Mod Collection](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3384083598).
   - Click **"Subscribe to All"** to ensure you have all the necessary mods installed.

6. **Launch the Game:**
   - Use the newly created `gmod.rtx.exe` to launch the game.
   - Once the game loads, open any map and press `~` to open the console.
   - Enter the following commands:
     ```
     rtx.pseudoplayer_unique_hashes 1
     rtx.pseudoweapon_unique_hashes 1
     ```
     This will allow you to tag your playermodel textures and weapon textures in the runtime without hiding the original textures when they appear in the game.

That's it! Youâ€™re all set. Enjoy your RTX-enhanced Garry's Mod experience. ðŸŽ‰
