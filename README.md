Makes the RTX-Remix install as easy as possible. Features a pre-configured rtx.conf that automatically selects the best DLSS option for your hardware, and hundreds of tagged and preconfigured textures for the runtime. This installer will periodically be updated to have the latest RTX-Runtime with its relative DXVK and Bridge.

‚ö†Ô∏è**Please note: This installation process works only with the 32-bit version of Garry's Mod.**

## üöÄ Install Instructions / Usage

### üî®Download and Install

1. **Download** the provided ZIP file from the [releases section](https://github.com/skurtyyskirts/GmodRTX/releases).

2. **Unzip** the downloaded folder.

3. **Choose your installation method:**

   - **Option 1 (Direct Installation):** Place the unzipped files directly into your main Garry's Mod game directory.
   - **Option 2 (Keep Gmod & GmodRTX Separate):**
     1. Make a copy of your Garry's Mod folder (e.g., `garrysmod`) and rename it to `GarrysmodRTX`.
     2. Place the unzipped files into the new `GarrysmodRTX` folder.

4. **Run the GmodInstaller:**

   - The installer will ask you to locate your `gmod.exe` file based on the directory you selected above.
   - This will create `gmod.rtx.exe`, which you'll use to launch the game.

5. **Subscribe to Required Mods:**

   - Visit my [Steam Workshop Mod Collection](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3384083598).
   - Click **"Subscribe to All"** to ensure you have all the necessary mods installed. Make sure you don't overwrite your existing mods.

6. **Launch the Game:**

   - Use the newly created `gmod.rtx.exe` to launch the game.
   - Once the game loads, load into any map and press `~` to open the console.
   - Enter the following commands:
     ```
     rtx.pseudoplayer_unique_hashes 1
     rtx.pseudoweapon_unique_hashes 1
     ```
     This will allow you to tag your playermodel textures and weapon textures in the runtime without hiding the original textures when they appear in the game. Press save to keep changes.

That's it! You‚Äôre all set. Enjoy your RTX-enhanced Garry's Mod experience. üéâ

### üßë‚Äçüíª Usage Notes

- **Adjusting Screen Size:** When launching the game through `gmod.rtx.exe`, the screen will initially appear small. You can adjust this through the in-game settings. Unfortunately, this adjustment will need to be repeated every time you launch the game.
- **Texture Tagging:** After loading into a map, remember to run the `rtx.pseudo` commands before tagging the original texture hashes as playermodel or weapon textures. For example, if you tag the SMG texture as a playermodel without enabling pseudo, the SMG will disappear anywhere it is found in the game.
- **To tag Playermodel Textures:** Open the RTX-Remix runtime menu with Alt+X. Click "Developer Settings Menu" on the bottom left. Then select "Game Setup" and then "Categorize Textures." Hover your mouse over your playermodel, then tag it as "Player Model Texture."
- **Mirrored Map Fix:** You'll notice in some maps you'll get a mirrored effect where the map will suddenly not look right. To fix this, open the console (`~`) and enter:
  ```
  ent_remove_all func_reflective_glass
  ```
