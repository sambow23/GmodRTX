GmodRTX is the easiest way to install RTX-Remix into Garrysmod, doing all of the heavy lifting for you. This project features a fully automated and open-source installer that includes a pre-configured rtx.conf file that will auto select the best DLSS options based on your hardware. It also comes packed with hundreds of pre-tagged textures optimized for the runtime, along with dedicated water, glass, and mirror mods. The installer is regularly updated with the latest RTX-Remix runtime, DXVK, and Bridge files to ensure compatibility and performance.
